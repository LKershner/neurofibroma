###Normalizing the data
###After removing unwanted cells from the dataset, the next step is to normalize the data. By default, we employ a global-scaling normalization method “LogNormalize” that normalizes the gene expression measurements for each cell by the total expression, multiplies this by a scale factor (10,000 by default), and log-transforms the result.
M <- NormalizeData(object = M, normalization.method = "LogNormalize", scale.factor = 10000)

# ## Detection of variable genes across the single cells
# #M <- MeanVarPlot(M,fxn.x = expMean, fxn.y = logVarDivMean, x.low.cutoff = 0.5, x.high.cutoff = 3, y.cutoff = 0.5, do.contour = F)
# M <- FindVariableGenes(object = M, mean.function = ExpMean, dispersion.function = LogVMR, x.low.cutoff = 0.0125, x.high.cutoff = 3, y.cutoff = 0.5)
# length(M@var.genes)


# Identification of highly variable features (feature selection)
# We next calculate a subset of features that exhibit high cell-to-cell variation in the dataset (i.e, they are highly expressed in some cells, and lowly expressed in others). We and others have found that focusing on these genes in downstream analysis helps to highlight biological signal in single-cell datasets.

M <- FindVariableFeatures(object = M, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)
# Identify the 10 most highly variable genes
top10 <- head(x = VariableFeatures(object = M), 10)
